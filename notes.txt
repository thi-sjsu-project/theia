ideas:

different types of elements(each element type extends element type, but have their own)
for assimilator prototype, just make it a 4x4 grid and find a place that is open
redux time travel
there should be a set "control console" for controlling a drone, with similar functionalities as the ownship
allow multiple widgets as a possible response to messages in selector
to assimilator: make an algorithm that pre calculates the areas of space within each section that are currently free
and update these areas when we add or remove something.
memory system, make sure we can store memory of how things have interacted. something like when a button was last pressed, 
why it was pressed, in response to what, etc. every single thing should connect and be traceable
widgets should have either 1 or any number of there own existance
widgets that can be more than one should have some parameters like "noUpdate" or "updateWhenFull" so we can control when more widgets can be placed and when they can be updated
elements when interacted with need to send the operation to state for the monitor to handle certain actions?
