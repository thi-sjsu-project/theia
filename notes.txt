ideas:

different types of elements(each element type extends element type, but have their own)
for assimilator prototype, just make it a 4x4 grid and find a place that is open
redux time travel
there should be a set "control console" for controlling a drone, with similar functionalities as the ownship
allow multiple widgets as a possible response to messages in selector
to assimilator: make an algorithm that pre calculates the areas of space within each section that are currently free
and update these areas when we add or remove something.
